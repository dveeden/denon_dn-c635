This is some very basic code which can be used
to send commands to the Denon DN-C635 CD player
via the RS-232 port.

I've used a RS-232-to-USB device for the connection.

This is based on http://www.jingle.org/DN-C635serial.pdf

I've no plans to extend this code, but feel free to
contact me if you need help.

The Python code works on Linux, but it should also
work on Windows or Mac.
